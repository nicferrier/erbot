;;; Commentary:

;; This is the barest of beginnings of SOAP support for Emacs. It
;; really doesn't do much of anything; to see how to use it, see
;; google.el. Someone who cares about SOAP should probably make
;; this into an actual SOAP implementation.

;;; Code:

(require 'url)

(defun soap-process-response (response-buffer)
  "Process the SOAP response in RESPONSE-BUFFER."
  (let ((retval nil))
    (with-current-buffer response-buffer
      (goto-char (point-min))
      (when (looking-at "^HTTP/1.* 200 OK$")
        (re-search-forward "^$" nil t 1)
        (setq retval (buffer-substring-no-properties (point) (point-max))))
      (kill-buffer response-buffer))
    (with-temp-buffer
      (insert "\n" retval "\n")
      (goto-char (point-min))
      (while (re-search-forward "\r" nil t)
        (replace-match ""))
      (xml-parse-region (point-min) (point-max)))))

(defun soap-request (url data)
  "Send and process SOAP request to URL with DATA."
  (let* ((url-request-extra-headers
          `(("Content-type" . "text/xml; charset=\"utf-8\"")
            ("SOAPAction" . ,(format "%S" url))))
         (url-request-method "POST")
         (url-request-data
          (concat "<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\" ?>\n"
                  data)))
    (soap-process-response (url-retrieve-synchronously url))))
