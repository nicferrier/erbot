;; <kensanata> deego: fsbot should get the old silly karma system back.  fsbot
;;             forget all karma points whenever he disconnects.  the only
;;             important thing is that we can say b0ef++ and fsbot responds with
;;             "Noted, kensanata.  One (brownie|karma|wiki|rms|lispy)-point for
;;             b0ef!"
