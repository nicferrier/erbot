	* erbmsg.el: (erbmsg-notify-msg-on-JOIN)
	- fixed bug with last-access used for the first time

2004-06-26  S Freundt  <hroptatyr@gna.org>

	* erbmsg.el: 
	- added dump routines to dump message hash tables to hard disk
	- added routines for restoring from dumped message files
	- added interval within erbot does not notify on channel joins
	- added erbmsg-new-msg-(pre|post)-hook

2004-06-13  S Freundt  <hroptatyr@gna.org>

	* erbot.el: added new var erbot-on-new-erc-p 
	and handlers for new erc-backend facilities.

	erc versions >1.660 use erc-backend.el to handle server
	events. erbot is now aware of these new handlers by
	determining the value `erbot-on-new-erc-p' when calling
	`erbot-install'.
	The new backend handlers' values are evaluated within
	`erbot-remote' fun.

2004-05-07  D Goel  <deego@gnufans.org>

	* erbwiki.el: Security, add new functions. 

	USING LINES < 0.3 FOR WIKI TRAINING WAS A SECURITY RISK, WE
	THINK.. THOUGH WE HAVEN'T FIGURED OUT HOW TO EXPLOIT IT.
	lines 0.3 and later fix that risk.

	Also add new functions to erbwiki.el suitable for parsing more
	wikis.

	noninteractive, else it starts a session!

2004-03-21  D Goel  <deego@gnufans.org>

	* erbc3.el: Redefine and move fs-setq here.
